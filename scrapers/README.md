# Uni Final Scrapers

Scrapers fetch data about offerings and put them into files

## CLI

You can compile the cli and run it from the compiled JS, or, more easily run it through yarn.

```shell script
# Get help
yarn run cli -- --help

# Scrape a specific offering
yarn run cli -- scrape --help
```
